## 0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp
In this web stack debugging task, we are testing how well our web server setup featuring Nginx is doing under pressure and it turns out it's not doing well: we are getting a huge amount of failed requests. The web stack is on of the sandboxes at ALX_Africa. This script is to fix those errors by incresing the number of requests ngix can take and then restart it using puppet

## 1-user_limit.pp
